# Inventory Application Guide

### Introduction
Hello! Welcome to my Github page, and thanks for stopping by this application!
Today, we're going to be going through the basics of how to navigate and use
the tools provided in this application, and how they work!

### Starting up
When you load up the Inventory Application, you'll see a basic UI showing a
table, a list of buttons to interact with that table, and below these you will
find a section for editing items. All of these will be crucial for using this
application properly. First, we'll go through each side-button and their functions.

### Side-Buttons
1. The Add Button serves to add a new, empty item into the list.
2. The Edit Button serves to take an item in the current list and allow you
to edit said item in the fields below.
3. The Clear Button is in charge of deleting all items from your current list.
4. The Delete Button serves to delete one item that the user has selected from the list.
5. The Search Button will take whatever the user has entered in the search bar and attempt to find any items that contain the search information.

### Menu-Buttons
1. The New Button is responsible for creating a new list by deleting all current items and adding one new empty item to the list,
similar to starting up the application for the first time.
2. The Save Button will save the current list in a format of the users choice,
with the option of using TXT, HTML, or JSON.
3. The Load Button will attempt to load a list that the user has previously saved using the
Inventory Application (This will not work properly with random files, obviously.)
4. The Close Button will stop all current tasks in the application and close, no questions asked.

### Confirm Button
The Confirm Button only serves one purpose, to verify that you've entered in correctly formatted data to replace the current
data inside your item. This includes, a valid serial number in the format A-XXX-XXX-XXX (A = Letter, X = Number),
a price that is greater than 0, and a name that is between 2 and 256 characters.

### Conclusion
Thanks for stopping by and taking a look at my software, i'm very proud to say that I can make a
basic application, and I hope to continue producing wonderful software in the future. Yours Truly, Randall Roberts.
